# tuberculosis_india_2020
Contains data downloaded from Indiastat.com on the tuberculosis cases notified in India, in 2020, from both private and public sector health institutes. In addition to timely detection and intervention, the WHO's recommendation to combat tuberculosis is to reduce the financial burden on the patients. Thus, the public sector institutes, that are heavily subsidized should be at the forefront to detect the TB cases. Sputum microbiological test remains the gold standard for detection of TB; however, in many cases the sputum shows no signs of bacteria. Thus there are genome-based tests such as CBNAAT that are more sensitive and can also identify if the bacteria is antibiotic resistant. However, CBNAAT tests are expensive and the only way to make it more accessible to general public is through government institutes. Though, some governments may not be able to afford expensive machines to run nucleic acid-based tests. Thus, sputum test still remains the mainstay of TB detection in poorer countries.
